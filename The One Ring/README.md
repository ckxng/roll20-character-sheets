# The One Ring Character Sheet for Roll20

This sheet works largely on its own, however Heilemann (the original sheet author) has also written [a lengthy setup guide for The One Ring in Roll20](https://ringen.squarespace.com/loremasters-journal/2014/10/26/the-one-ring-setup-for-roll-20).

The roll buttons assume you have a number of rollable tables (`feat`, `lm-feat`, `normal` and `weary`) setup, as described on [the Roll20 Wiki page for The One Ring](https://wiki.roll20.net/The_One_Ring).

### Loremaster and Adversary sheets

This is in fact three character sheets in one. A full-on Player Character sheet and two Loremaster sheets meant for characters (that is people who are on the side of the players) and adversaries (that is characters who are not, or creatures). The two former use the `feat` table for rolls, and the latter uses the `lm-feat` table (and has Hate instead of Hope).

### Internationalisation

This sheet has been optimised for English, French, German and Spanish translations. Players who have previously been using the "L'Anneau Unique" and "Der Eine Ring" character sheets can convert to using this version of "The One Ring" sheet without loss of data.
